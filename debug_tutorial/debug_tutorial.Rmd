# Runtime C++ debugging

It is important to be able to debug run time errors that occur in
the C++ code. RStudio has great functionality for debugging R
code, but the corrsponding tools for C++ are more primitive. 
We will assume that you are using the `gcc` compiler, and the
accompayning `gdb` debugger.

#### Operating system specific notes
* Linux: debugging works without problems
* Mac: ?
* Windows: The behaviour of `gdb` has varied across
  versions of R and Rtools. In case of problems, please consult: [https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki/Windows-installation#windows-debugging](https://github.com/kaskr/adcomp/wiki/Windows-installation#windows-debugging). Further, allthough it is possible to run the simple example in this tutorial under Windows, larger .cpp files will not work. It is generally recommended to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). It is a bit of work setting it up, but once installed it is easy to switch over to that whenever it is necessary to use the debugger.

### In this example you will learn

* Set up TMB so that the debugger can be used
* Run the debugger to locate the line number in the C++ file *where* the error occured
* Print the content of variables, such as array dimensions, which helps you understand *why* the error occured

### Full code for example
<details> <summary> R code</summary>
```r 
library(TMB)
compile("debug_tutorial.cpp",flags="-O0 -g",DLLFLAGS="",libtmb=FALSE)
# Note to Windows user: flags="-O1 -g" must be used for larger programs,
#                       but does not gives worse debugger functionality

dyn.load(dynlib("debug_tutorial"))

dat <- list(X=matrix(1:6,nrow=3,ncol=2),y=1:5)
pars <- list(a=0)
obj <- MakeADFun(data=dat, parameters=pars, DLL="debug_tutorial")
```
</details>

<details> <summary> C++ code</summary>
```c++
// Debugger (gdb) tutorial
#include <TMB.hpp>

template<class Type>
Type objective_function<Type>::operator() ()
{
  DATA_MATRIX(X);
  DATA_VECTOR(y);
  PARAMETER(a);
  
  X(0,0);
  for(int i=1; i<=y.size(); i++){
    y(i);  // Out-of-range error when i == y.size()
  }
  
  Type nll = a;
  return nll;
}

```
</details>

***

### Description
A common mistake made by new TMB users 
is to forget that in C++ indexing starts at zero
and ends at dimension-1. In our example this happens in the lines
```c++
  for(int i=1; i<=y.size(); i++){
    y(i);  // Out-of-range error when i == y.size()
  }
```
This is a typical situation where the debugger is useful, because it can point to the line where the error occurs.

### A guided tour through `gdb`
<details> <summary> Verify that the error crashes R</summary>
```r 
  source("debug_tutorial.R")`
```
</details>

<details> <summary> Compile the program with debugging information.
</summary>
```r 
  library(TMB)
  compile("debug_tutorial.cpp",flags="-O0 -g",DLLFLAGS="",libtmb=FALSE)
```
This is needed for the debugger to be able to show your C++ code.
Note that this command has allready been run if you followed
the first step.
</details>

<details> <summary> Source the R script using `gdbsource()`.
</summary>
```r 
gdbsource("debug_tutorial.R",interactive=TRUE)
```
This a "safe" version of `source()` which prevents R from crashing.

If `gdb` is working properly on your system this will take you into the debugger
(exact behavior depends on your system). Under Windows
it brings up a terminal windown  with text flushing through, 
and ending with: 
```r
> obj <- MakeADFun(data=dat, parameters=pars, DLL="debug_tutorial")
TMB has received an error from Eigen. The following condition was not met:
index >= 0 && index < size()
Please check your matrix-vector bounds etc., or run your program through a debug
ger.

Breakpoint 1, 0x00000000156bf7e8 in abort ()
   from D:\github\tmb-courses\bergen_june18\debug_tutorial.dll
#0  0x00000000156bf7e8 in abort ()
   from D:\github\tmb-courses\bergen_june18\debug_tutorial.dll
#1  0x0000000015737a77 in Eigen::DenseCoeffsBase<Eigen::Array<double, -1, 1, 0,
-1, 1>, 1>::operator() (this=0x441ce60, index=5)

sBase.h:425
---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---
```
You recognize the first part of this as an error message from TMB. Press the `return`
key a few times until you see something like:
```r 
#16 0x000000000040155a in ?? ()
#17 0x00000000004013e8 in ?? ()
#18 0x000000000040151b in ?? ()
#19 0x00000000775159cd in KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk ()
   from C:\Windows\system32\kernel32.dll
#20 0x000000007767383d in ntdll!RtlUserThreadStart ()
   from C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll
#21 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
Backtrace stopped: previous frame inner to this frame (corrupt stack?)
Warning: the current language does not match this frame.
(gdb)
```
You see the `gdb` prompt at the end (where debugging commands can be entered). 
You have now verified that the `gdb` is working properly.
</details>

<details> <summary> Make  `gdb` show you the line with the error.
</summary>

At the `(gdb)` promt in the terminal window, give the command `frame 2`:
```r
(gdb) frame 2
#2  0x00000000156cd5e4 in objective_function<double>::operator() (
    this=0x441cf40) at debug_tutorial.cpp:14
14          y(i);  // Out-of-range error when i == y.size()
(gdb)
```
This prints the code line that caused the crash. Usually this
is enough to find the source of the error, but below we will 
explore more advanced debugging features.

**Comment** The appropriate "frame number" (here \#2) will vary from model to model. 
Experiment with different numbers in the range 2-5 until you see the text
 `in objective_function<double>::operator()` (and the name of your .cpp file).
</details>

<details> <summary> How do I quit the debugger?
</summary>

Type `quit` followed `y`:
```r
(gdb) quit
A debugging session is active.

        Inferior 1 [process 3996] will be killed.

Quit anyway? (y or n) y
```

</details>


<details> <summary> A quicker way to find the line number.
</summary>

If you are only interested in the line number of the error (does not currently work under Windows):
```r 
gdbsource("debug_tutorial.R",interactive=FALSE)
```
</details>

<details> <summary> Print the value of variables
</summary>

It is very useful to  be able to see the value stored
in variables when the crash occurred. For example, we know
the error occured in a loop, and we would like to know for which
value of `i`:
```r 
(gdb) print i
$1 = 5
```
You can also find the dimension of vectors, arrays, and matrices.
Here are a few examples:
```r 
(gdb) print y.size()
$2 = 5
(gdb) print X.cols()
$3 = 2
(gdb) print X.rows()
$4 = 3
```
Hence, we know that the maximum allowed index value for `i` is 4 (5-1 due to
the fact that C++ arrays are zero indexed),
which explains why the crash occured.

<details> <summary> More about printing of variables, vectors, matrices, ...
</summary>

The above exercise did not show how to print the content of a vector, say.
To allow that we have written some special functions in the file `debug_print.hpp` which you can extend if necessary. Some examples 
of printing:
```r 
(gdb) p print(y)
12
13
14
15
16
$1 = void
(gdb) p print(X)
1 4
2 5
3 6
$2 = void
```
